# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Work-day-schedualer is a daily scheduale planner. It simulates the working hours from 9am till 5pm.

## Work-day-schedualer is giving us an option to save our notes/reminders in local storage and even after refreshing the page they are still there to remind us about our tasks we need to do.

## It is  build on program laguages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
## Our daily schedualer also uses librarys like Bootstrap, MomentJs, and JQuery .

## We used MomentJs library to represent our curent day, month, year and also the curen time so we can know in our schedualer what time is past, curent or future. Curent time it is represented with red color, past time with gray and future with green color.

## Bootstrap library we used it to modify our HTML file for exsample: save widget on the right side of the schedualer who is saving our notes.

## JQuery librabry we used in JavaScript file so we can build our JavaScript file to modify our HTML and CSS files who were given as a starter code. One exsample of how we used it is: the function where we checking our curent time and acording to that we do the colors for past(grey), curent(red) and future(green).
